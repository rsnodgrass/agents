# Usage Guide

Complete guide to using agents, slash commands, and multi-agent workflows.

## Overview

The plugin ecosystem provides two primary interfaces:

1. **Slash Commands** - Direct invocation of tools and workflows
2. **Natural Language** - Claude reasons about which agents to use

## Slash Commands

Slash commands are the primary interface for working with agents and workflows. Each plugin provides namespaced commands that you can run directly.

### Command Format

```bash
/plugin-name:command-name [arguments]
```

### Discovering Commands

List all available slash commands from installed plugins:

```bash
/plugin
```

### Benefits of Slash Commands

- **Direct invocation** - No need to describe what you want in natural language
- **Structured arguments** - Pass parameters explicitly for precise control
- **Composability** - Chain commands together for complex workflows
- **Discoverability** - Use `/plugin` to see all available commands

## Natural Language

Agents can also be invoked through natural language when you need Claude to reason about which specialist to use:

```
"Use backend-architect to design the authentication API"
"Have security-auditor scan for OWASP vulnerabilities"
"Get performance-engineer to optimize this database query"
```

Claude Code automatically selects and coordinates the appropriate agents based on your request.

## Multi-Agent Workflow Examples

Plugins provide pre-configured multi-agent workflows accessible via slash commands.

### Full-Stack Development

```bash
# Command-based workflow invocation
/full-stack-orchestration:full-stack-feature "user dashboard with real-time analytics"

# Natural language alternative
"Implement user dashboard with real-time analytics"
```

**Orchestration:** backend-architect → database-architect → frontend-developer → test-automator → security-auditor → deployment-engineer → observability-engineer

**What happens:**

1. Database schema design with migrations
2. Backend API implementation (REST/GraphQL)
3. Frontend components with state management
4. Comprehensive test suite (unit/integration/E2E)
5. Security audit and hardening
6. CI/CD pipeline setup with feature flags
7. Observability and monitoring configuration

### Security Hardening

```bash
# Comprehensive security assessment and remediation
/security-scanning:security-hardening --level comprehensive

# Natural language alternative
"Perform security audit and implement OWASP best practices"
```

**Orchestration:** security-auditor → backend-security-coder → frontend-security-coder → mobile-security-coder → test-automator

### Data/ML Pipeline

```bash
# ML feature development with production deployment
/machine-learning-ops:ml-pipeline "customer churn prediction model"

# Natural language alternative
"Build customer churn prediction model with deployment"
```

**Orchestration:** data-scientist → data-engineer → ml-engineer → mlops-engineer → performance-engineer

### Incident Response

```bash
# Smart debugging with root cause analysis
/incident-response:smart-fix "production memory leak in payment service"

# Natural language alternative
"Debug production memory leak and create runbook"
```

**Orchestration:** incident-responder → devops-troubleshooter → debugger → error-detective → observability-engineer

## Command Arguments and Options

Many slash commands support arguments for precise control:

```bash
# Test generation for specific files
/unit-testing:test-generate src/api/users.py

# Feature development with methodology specification
/backend-development:feature-development OAuth2 integration with social login

# Security dependency scanning
/security-scanning:security-dependencies

# Component scaffolding
/frontend-mobile-development:component-scaffold UserProfile component with hooks

# TDD workflow cycle
/tdd-workflows:tdd-red User can reset password
/tdd-workflows:tdd-green
/tdd-workflows:tdd-refactor

# Smart debugging
/debugging-toolkit:smart-debug memory leak in checkout flow

# Python project scaffolding
/python-development:python-scaffold fastapi-microservice
```

## Combining Natural Language and Commands

You can mix both approaches for optimal flexibility:

```
# Start with a command for structured workflow
/full-stack-orchestration:full-stack-feature "payment processing"

# Then provide natural language guidance
"Ensure PCI-DSS compliance and integrate with Stripe"
"Add retry logic for failed transactions"
"Set up fraud detection rules"
```

## Best Practices

### When to Use Slash Commands

- **Structured workflows** - Multi-step processes with clear phases
- **Repetitive tasks** - Operations you perform frequently
- **Precise control** - When you need specific parameters
- **Discovery** - Exploring available functionality

### When to Use Natural Language

- **Exploratory work** - When you're not sure which tool to use
- **Complex reasoning** - When Claude needs to coordinate multiple agents
- **Contextual decisions** - When the right approach depends on the situation
- **Ad-hoc tasks** - One-off operations that don't fit a command

### Workflow Composition

Compose multiple plugins for complex scenarios:

```bash
# 1. Start with feature development
/backend-development:feature-development payment processing API

# 2. Add security hardening
/security-scanning:security-hardening

# 3. Generate comprehensive tests
/unit-testing:test-generate

# 4. Review the implementation
/code-review-ai:ai-review

# 5. Set up CI/CD
/cicd-automation:workflow-automate

# 6. Add monitoring
/observability-monitoring:monitor-setup
```
